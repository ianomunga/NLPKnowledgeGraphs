Knowledge Graphs as Dimensionality Reduction Tools

Knowledge graphs like these help make more massive models that will work on tasks that need semantic insight become more efficient. I will keep on working on this method as a dimensionality reduction approach, that could possibly be completely automated and generalized into a production algorithm of its own.
